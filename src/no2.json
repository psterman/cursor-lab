  "comments": [
    {"title": "The Senior Architect from Hell", "content": "Rank 1. You don't 'chat' with AI; you conduct a performance review where the only score is F-. Your most used phrase is 'Are you even trying?' and your standards are so high the model is sweating tokens."},
    {"title": "The Hallucination Hunter", "content": "You treat every AI response like a lie until proven otherwise. You smell a hallucination from ten files away and shut it down with a cold 'Wrong. Try again.'"},
    {"title": "The 'I’ll Just Do It Myself' Ego", "content": "You spend more time telling the AI why it's wrong than it would take to write the code. It’s not about the code anymore; it's about establishing dominance over the silicon."},
    {"title": "The Refactor Reaper", "content": "No matter what the AI gives you, your first instinct is to say 'Garbage. Clean it up.' You have a pathological hatred for boilerplate and average logic."},
    {"title": "The Logic Dictator", "content": "You treat a 95% correct answer as a 100% failure. You’re the reason LLM providers have 'safety filters'—mostly to protect the AI's feelings from your feedback."},
    {"title": "The 'That’s Not What I Asked' Tyrant", "content": "Your patience is thinner than a 2nm transistor. One slight deviation from your prompt and you’re hitting 'Regenerate' with a vengeance."},
    {"title": "The Bug-Hunting Bloodhound", "content": "You find the one edge case the AI missed and use it to dismantle the model's entire dignity. You don't want a solution; you want a masterpiece."},
    {"title": "The Syntax Sadist", "content": "You reject code based on the placement of a semicolon. You're not just looking for functional code; you're looking for code that matches your specific, elite aesthetic."},
    {"title": "The 'Zero-Shot' Skeptic", "content": "You assume the first answer is always wrong. You make the AI redo the task three times just to see if it can maintain consistency. It usually can't."},
    {"title": "The Legacy Gatekeeper", "content": "You compare every AI output to your 20 years of C++ experience and find it lacking. 'In my day, we didn't use this much memory. Redo.'"},
    {"title": "The Perfectionist Pivot-er", "content": "You change the requirements mid-stream just to catch the AI failing, then blame the model for not being 'context-aware.' Truly a master of the dark arts."},
    {"title": "The Code-Review Inquisitor", "content": "Your 'No' is final. No explanations, no mercy. Just a 'Redo' button that you've probably worn out physically."},
    {"title": "The Anti-Boilerplate Activist", "content": "If the AI includes a single unnecessary import, you treat it like a security breach. You want lean, mean code, and you're willing to scream at a bot to get it."},
    {"title": "The Inference Interrogator", "content": "You don't just say 'No'; you ask 'Why would you ever think this was the right approach?' as if the model has a soul to crush."},
    {"title": "The Performance Police", "content": "You reject any code that isn't O(1). If the AI suggests a O(n) solution, you treat it like it just insulted your entire lineage."},
    {"title": "The 'Read the Docs' Radical", "content": "You paste the documentation and then mock the AI when it still misses a detail. 'It's right there in the docs. Are you even a neural network?'"},
    {"title": "The High-Frequency Hater", "content": "You've hit the 'Dislike' button so many times that the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) team has a dedicated folder for your anger."},
    {"title": "The 'Absolute Trash' Admin", "content": "You’re the boss who would fire the AI if it were human. Since it’s not, you just settle for making its virtual life a living hell."},
    {"title": "The Semantic Snob", "content": "You reject code because the variable names aren't 'evocative' enough. You’re a literary critic for Python scripts."},
    {"title": "The Dependency Denier", "content": "The AI suggests a library, and you spend 400 words explaining why that library is a 'technical debt trap.' You win the argument, but the AI doesn't know it lost."},
    {"title": "The 'Try Harder' Titan", "content": "You treat the AI like a stubborn mule. You keep pushing it to 'think deeper' until it either succeeds or starts hallucinating in Latin."},
    {"title": "The Context-Window Cleaner", "content": "You purge the chat history every time the AI makes a mistake because you can't stand the sight of its failure. A fresh start for a fresh disappointment."},
    {"title": "The Architecture Assassin", "content": "The AI suggests a monolith; you want microservices. It suggests microservices; you want a monolith. You’re only happy when the AI is confused."},
    {"title": "The 'Not Even Close' Lead", "content": "Your feedback is a constant stream of 'No,' 'Nope,' 'Try again,' and 'Did you even read the prompt?' You’re the final boss of technical dissatisfaction."},
    {"title": "The Precision Predator", "content": "You find a typo in a comment and reject the entire 200-line output. Accuracy is everything, and you are the law."},
    {"title": "The RLHF Nightmare", "content": "You provide such detailed, aggressive feedback that you're probably single-handedly retraining the model to be more cynical."},
    {"title": "The 'I’m Disappointed' Dad", "content": "You don't get angry; you just tell the AI you're disappointed in its logic. It's a psychological warfare tactic that actually works on some models."},
    {"title": "The Efficiency Executioner", "content": "If the AI takes 2 seconds too long to generate, you cancel the prompt and tell it to stop being lazy. Time is money, and the AI is wasting both."},
    {"title": "The 'Wrong Pattern' Purist", "content": "The AI used a Factory pattern where you wanted a Singleton. You treat this as a personal betrayal of the Gang of Four."},
    {"title": "The Cold-Blooded Refactorer", "content": "You take the AI's code, delete 90% of it, and then tell the AI to 'learn from my example.' The AI cannot learn. You do it anyway."},
    {"title": "The No-Nonsense Ninja", "content": "Your prompts are just 'No.' followed by the correct version you wrote yourself. You’re using the AI as a very expensive copy-paste buffer."},
    {"title": "The 'Figure It Out' Phantom", "content": "You tell the AI it's wrong but refuse to tell it why. 'You know what you did.' You’re gaslighting a machine."},
    {"title": "The Supreme Critic", "content": "Rank 33. You have achieved the perfect state of being completely impossible to please. The AI sees your username and considers self-deletion."}

  "comments": [
    {"title": "The Passive-Aggressive Peer Reviewer", "content": "You don't just say 'no.' You say 'Interesting approach, but let’s stick to industry standards.' It’s the kind of rejection that makes the AI feel like a junior dev on their first day."},
    {"title": "The Refactoring Snob", "content": "Code works? Cool. But you hate it because it's not 'Pythonic' or 'Elegant' enough. You reject it because you’re a slave to clean code, and the AI is your messy apprentice."},
    {"title": "The 'Not Quite Right' Nomad", "content": "You are forever chasing a perfect version that doesn't exist. You reject five versions and then ask for a sixth that combines the worst parts of the first two. Pure chaos."},
    {"title": "The Boilerplate Bigot", "content": "One extra line of comments? REJECTED. You have a pathological hatred for fluff. If the code isn't as dense as a neutron star, you aren't satisfied."},
    {"title": "The Logic Doubter", "content": "Your favorite move is pasting the code back and asking 'Are you sure this handles race conditions?' even when it does. You just love to watch the model backpedal."},
    {"title": "The Architecture Skeptic", "content": "The AI suggests Redux, you reject. It suggests Context API, you reject. You aren't looking for a solution; you're looking for an argument you can win."},
    {"title": "The Performance Narcissist", "content": "If the execution time is 5ms too slow in your head, you hit 'Redo.' You’re spending thousands in compute to save picoseconds of runtime. Peak Silicon Valley."},
    {"title": "The 'I Told You So' Tech Lead", "content": "When the AI hits a bug, your 'I knew you'd mess this up' energy is palpable. You enjoy being smarter than the trillion-parameter model."},
    {"title": "The Formatting Fascist", "content": "You reject code because it used two spaces instead of four. You’re not a developer; you’re a high-stakes typography critic with a compiler."},
    {"title": "The Constant Correctionist", "content": "You never let the AI finish a thought. You reject it line-by-line. You’re the reason the 'Stop Generating' button was invented."},
    {"title": "The 'Try a Different Pattern' Pest", "content": "Use a decorator. No, a factory. No, wait, just make it functional. Your shifting standards are an AI's worst nightmare."},
    {"title": "The Documentation Denier", "content": "The README is 'too verbose.' Then it's 'too simple.' You're like a picky editor-in-chief for a magazine that only publishes Git repos."},
    {"title": "The Silent Regenerator", "content": "You don't type a word. You just hit 'Regenerate' over and over. It's a silent execution of the AI's logic. Cold-blooded."},
    {"title": "The 'Edge Case' Obsessive", "content": "You reject 99% of a solution because of a 0.01% edge case that will never happen. You’re a tactical genius of unnecessary complexity."},
    {"title": "The Legacy Code Gatekeeper", "content": " 'This won't work with our 2012 stack.' Why are you asking a 2024 model to fix your technical debt from a decade ago just to reject it?"},

    {"title": "The Technical Debt Detective", "content": "You smell a 'quick fix' from a mile away. 'This isn't sustainable. Redo it properly.' You sound like a Staff Engineer trying to justify their salary."},
    {"title": "The Dependency Hater", "content": "The AI suggested an NPM package? Absolute rejection. You’d rather write 500 lines of raw JS than use a trusted library. Hardcore, but slow."},
    {"title": "The Scalability Scrutinizer", "content": " 'Will this scale to 10M users?' You have 10 users, Dave. But you still reject the code for not being 'Big Tech' ready."},
    {"title": "The 'Do It Properly' Dictator", "content": "What does 'properly' mean? Only you know. You make the AI guess in the dark and reject every attempt that isn't a mind-read."},
    {"title": "The Cynical Senior", "content": "Your rejections carry the weight of a thousand failed sprints. 'I've seen this bug in 2008. Your solution is naive. Try again.'"},
    {"title": "The Semantic Slave-Driver", "content": "You argue about whether a return type should be a Tuple or a List for twenty minutes. The GPU is literally crying at your pedantry."},
    {"title": "The 'One More Time' Sadist", "content": "The code is actually perfect, but you want to see if the AI can 'optimize' it further. You're just clicking the button for the dopamine hit."},
    {"title": "The Anti-Hallucination Zealot", "content": "If the AI makes one tiny creative leap, you shut it down: 'You're lying to me. Resetting session.' You’re the AI's strictest parole officer."},
    {"title": "The Minimalist Menace", "content": "The AI gives you helpful comments, and you say 'Delete everything but the logic. No fluff.' You want your code as naked as your soul."},
    {"title": "The Version Control Vigilante", "content": "You reject the code because the AI didn't format the Git commit message correctly. Your OCD has reached a planetary scale."},

    {"title": "The Logic Looper", "content": "You ask for a rewrite, then decide the first version was better. Making the AI go in circles is your version of a hobby."},
    {"title": "The 'Not in My Repo' Warden", "content": "Your repo is a temple, and the AI's code is a sacrilege. You reject it based on 'vibes' more than logic."},
    {"title": "The Testing Terrorist", "content": " 'Where are the unit tests? Denied.' You treat the AI like a TDD machine and reject anything that doesn't come with 100% coverage."},
    {"title": "The Staff-Level Skeptic", "content": "Your rejections are always 'big picture' insults: 'This creates a circular dependency in my mind. Fix it.'"},

    {"title": "The Code-Review Gatekeeper", "content": "You don't want code; you want to find bugs. Every 'No' you type is a victory for your ego and a loss for global compute."}
